I am Francis Baker, I am a 22-year old Full Time Student focusing on Information Technology with a minor in Business from [University of Massachusetts: Lowell][umass]. Besides that, I love developing websites and currently working on various projects which you I write about very often. This blog is currently being hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and currently using [Jekyll][jekyll] to transform this website into what you see, this was my first time using both of these services and you will see me write about them more often now. As I blog about my projects and grow to learn about various frameworks and API's I will document it on here. 

This blog is going to be used for various things from me talking about my projects, to my real life, and so much more. Eventually I may enable comments but as of right now, I will keep it locked and more used just as a blogging space to document my thoughts.

A little more about me, I am currently working for [Apple](https://Apple.com/) as an iOS Senior Advisor from my house, yes working from home is awesome but it does have its challenges, which I may document later and give some tips on how to potentially overcome those. I have been working for Apple now for a little over 1year and 6months so far, it's been a great ride but I am looking to truly get my foot into something more Web Developer related.
