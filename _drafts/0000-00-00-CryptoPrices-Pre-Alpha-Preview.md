Within the next few days we will be rolling into pre-alpha, this is for now closed and only certain people can access the website with a special URL. While I break this more and make progress I don't want people's first impressions to be negatitive, I want this project to WOW people. With this website I am working on key features that some website's already have and some I want to have. 

Things that will come soon, 

- Watchlist 
- Sharing / Inviting people to Watch List 
- SMS Notifactions / Email notifactions 
- Coin News 
- Graph Data for all time

I want this website to be the one stop show for everything about your crypto. This project is going to be something I will work on in my freetime so if you have any suggestions please do drop a comment so I can add to it.
