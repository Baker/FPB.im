### Intro

With the recent updates Twitch has Launched, I decided I will be rebranding my Twitch completely. I have always been a big fan of the simple/clean look and ultimately decided to go with that type of look with my Twitch. 

With the revamp of my Twitch, I needed various things for it such as 

- Panels 
- Offline Screen
- Welcome Screen
- Intermission Screen 
- Subscriber Badges for various times of staying subscribed 
- and more

    I am not the best with Photoshop or doing any graphic design, I wish I could have just coded it. So if you have any constructive criticism please do send it my way I would be more than grateful. 

### Color Scheme 

Now the biggest issue I ran into was the actualy color scheme to go with, I have always been a fan of `Dark` theme'd websites, hence why if you have ever seen any of my sites they are always dark. Now with my Twitch I felt it wouldn't be any difference. So my background color with revamp I didn't want it to be pure black as I feel that doesn't look pleasing to the eye but make it a dark grey. I also went with an orange for the made color. 

As from what I have heard from fellow Designers, they say Orange is one of the hardest color's to work with. From what I can see most if not all major companies rarely or never use Orange in the design. After looking into what Orange means I have discovered it matches exactly how I want my stream to be!

    Orange is the color of joy and creativity. Orange promotes a sense of general wellness and emotional energy that should be shared, such as compassion, passion, and warmth. Orange will help a person recover from disappointments, a wounded heart, or a blow to oneâ€™s pride.
