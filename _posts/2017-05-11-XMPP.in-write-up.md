Since early 2010 I have always had a passion for Internet Security, around 2015 I bought the Domain [XMPP.in](https://XMPP.in), which I ultimately made it a XMPP/Jabber server for the open public. By the beginning of 2017 I had about 22,000 registered accounts, and on a daily basis I received anywhere from 1-5 emails requesting password assistance. To protect customers data and accounts, I made it clear on our website we would NOT assist with any password resetting, the main reason for this was simply because how can I verify its you? and not just someone attempting to Social Engineer us. 


#### Backend 

The server we ran it on was Ubuntu 16.04 build, and we used [prosody](http://prosody.im) to power our server. One thing I wanted to make sure was people who cared for security was able to review our files that we could show. Some examples of these files can be viewed in our [Github](https://github.com/XMPPin), some examples of what you will find under the `Misc` folder is our `Prosody.cfg.lua`, this was our config file and showed exactly what modules we used at the time. One of the main ones I was excited to use was `Onion`, which allowed us to use both our main domain [XMPP.in](https://XMPP.in) and our Tor domain, which I will not mention. This project brought a bunch of new things to my eye, one being settings up a Tor domain or a .onion, if you haven't heard of Tor yet it has a lot of hate due to a lot of the domains on the network being related to illegal activity such as Drug Deals, Hitman for Hire and worse *Yes thats possible*. You can read more about the TorProject [here](https://www.torproject.org/). For our DB we used [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), as with Prosody that seemed the most effective for me at the time, as I was use to using that with other site's such as Wordpress, etc.

#### Current & Future Plans.. 

My plans for the future with this project, is to expand it more. I ultimately want to make it possible to register online, implement some sort of Two Factor auth or something among those lines. Also create a one-time recovery key or backup passwords, these are just thoughts. Currently I am reworking a front-end revamp here soon.
