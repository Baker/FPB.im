With the recent updates Twitch has Launched, I decided I will be rebranding my Twitch completely. I have always been a big fan of the simple/clean look and ultimately decided to go with that type of look with my Twitch. 

With the revamp of my Twitch, I needed various things for it such as 

- Panels 
- Offline Screen
- Welcome Screen
- Intermission Screen 
- Subscriber Badges for various times of staying subscribed 
- and more

    ** I am not the best with Photoshop or doing any graphic design, I wish I could have just coded it. So if you have any constructive criticism please do send it my way I would be more than grateful. **

Now the biggest issue I ran into was the actualy color scheme to go with, I have always been a fan of `Dark` theme'd websites, hence why if you have ever seen any of my sites they are always dark. Now with my Twitch I felt it wouldn't be any difference.
