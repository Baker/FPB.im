### My Portfolio is LIVE! 

I get this question a lot with talking to various companies, `Francis do you have a portfolio I can see?` My response prior today has always been sadly no, may make one later. Well, today I threw one together and made it how I make most of my website's nice and dark and beautiful. 

With this portfolio which is completely open source so take a look, fork it, make it your own, etc, I decided to use various CSS Frameworks that I have used in the past, such as [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) and [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.io), if you haven't used either I truly recommend them as they save me so much time all the time with Graphic Design etc. 

With this website, I wanted it to be simple and clean and show various projects to show I have the experience and show the history of me making progress with Web Development over the years. 

### Current Plans & Future Plans 

I have ideas that I am slowly gonna implement over time, but as of right now, I want to add more of my previous worked website's I just need to upload and host them on my dev server. 

I still need to do some of the write-ups of the projects listed on my website, and I will be doing that over the next couple of days so keep an eye out for updates and how I put those pieces of *art* together.
